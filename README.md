# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my Machine Learning (ML) projects. Each folder represents an individual project and includes:
- A `README.md` explaining that project's details (including group work, if applicable).
- Code, data (if applicable), and outputs.
- A license file (if applicable) specific to that project.

The folder names correspond to the project topics or titles.

Licenses vary across projects. Please check the individual project folders for specific license information.
